A browser based p2p file transfer platform

What is reep.io?
---
reep.io uses modern WebRTC technology to enable peer-to-peer file transfers between two browser.

Peer-to-Peer file transfers
---
With reep.io (reep = peer spelled backwars, duh) you can transfer files directly to another browser. You can transfer anything you want without storing the data on a server first. You can even stream video files or preview images directly. 

Privacy
---
reep.io's only purpose is to make it easy for you to connect to your buddy by providing you with a link that automatically connects you both. After the initial handshake we are out. The file transfer now only happens between you two without up- and downloading the file to a server.

Security
---
The whole communication is encrypted using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) using SSL. This reduces the risk of man in the middle attacks.
